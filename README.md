<h4>Abstract </h4>
The Circular Repository is an innovative e-management initiative of circulars for
transparent and responsive management within an organization. It is a
web-based software. This system helps us with creation, controlled
dissemination and retrieval of the circulars in seconds, and also provides the
feature for downloading the desired circular besides giving the view of the latest
circulars on board.
</br> <br>
It is built query-friendly which is achieved by making API calls along with great
UI, providing authorized access to the admins to manage the repository and a
direct access to the users to operate within the circular repository. It also
addresses the requirement of searching a focused circular in the abundant
information through advanced multi-parameter search facilities.
